# DigitalEscapeRoom
Collaborated with a team to design a multi-level digital escape room experience. Together we pitched our ideas, planned out our rooms, then individually coded the front-end of the site using HTML/CSS/JS. After completing each iteration I conducted UX testing with peers and refined the puzzle to make it more intuitive.
